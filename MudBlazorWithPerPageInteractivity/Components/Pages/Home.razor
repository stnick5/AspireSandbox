<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">This is a demo MudBlazor project. InteractiveMode is set per page rather than globally in App.razor.</MudText>
<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">The Weather page loads weather data from the BlazorDemo.WeatherApiService project into a MudDataGrid, with Redis caching enabled.</MudText>
<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">Unlike the 'MudBlazorDemo' project, the Redis cache works in this project. However, because InteractiveMode hasn't been set globally, the MudBlazor controls, such as the navbar and the theme toggle button don't work.</MudText>
